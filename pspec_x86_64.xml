        <Summary xml:lang="en">Gpart is a small tool which tries to guess what partitions are there on a drive.</Summary>
        <Description xml:lang="en">Gpart is a small tool which tries to guess what partitions are on a PC type, MBR-partitioned hard disk in case the primary partition table was damaged.

Gpart works by scanning through the device (or file) given on the command line on a sector basis. Each guessing module is asked if it thinks a filesystem it knows about could start at a given sector. Several filesystem guessing modules are built in.
